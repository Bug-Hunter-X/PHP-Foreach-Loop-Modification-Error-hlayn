# PHP Foreach Loop Modification Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP when modifying an array while iterating over it using a `foreach` loop.  The provided `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.php` offers a corrected version.  The core issue is that directly modifying the array's structure within the `foreach` loop leads to unpredictable results, as it can skip elements or cause unexpected index behavior.

## Understanding the Problem

The standard `foreach` loop is designed to be efficient, but its behavior can change if the underlying array structure is altered. This particular example involves attempting to unset array elements within the loop. As a result of removing an element the indices can shift and the loop won't proceed as expected. 

## Solution

The solution involves creating a copy of the array or using a different iterative approach that avoids modifying the array structure during iteration.
